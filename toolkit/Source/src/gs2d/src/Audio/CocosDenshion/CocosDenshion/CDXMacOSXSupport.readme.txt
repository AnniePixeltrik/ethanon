Original CDXMacOSXSupport.x files have been replaced by the ones available in this Gist: https://gist.github.com/andrew0/1172770

The reason why is that AVAudioPlayer has been merged into Apple's default API (after 10.7 or so). Double definitions were causing random crashes that could drive anyone nuts.
